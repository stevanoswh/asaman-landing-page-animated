## 1. Purpose

This Cookie & Tracking Policy explains how Asaman Technologies Ltd. uses cookies and similar tracking technologies on its websites, web portals, and mobile applications. We use cookies to ensure the platform functions properly, enhance user experience, and understand how our services are used; always in compliance with applicable privacy laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Singapore PDPA, and China’s Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL). This Policy should be read with Asaman’s Privacy Policy, available at **www.asaman.net/terms-and-policies**.

## 2. What Are The Cookies?

Cookies are small text files stored on your browser, computer, or device when you visit a website. They help websites remember information about your session, such as login status, preferences, and usage activity. Cookies used by Asaman do not store any passwords or financial information and cannot access files or data on your device.

## 3. Types of Cookies Used

Asaman uses the following types of cookies and similar technologies:

### a. Strictly Necessary Cookies

These cookies are essential for the platform to function correctly. They enable core services such as secure login, navigation, and session management. Without them, certain parts of the site may not function properly.

**Examples:**
- Authentication cookies for school and staff login
- Session management tokens
- Security verification cookies (anti-CSRF, load balancing)

### b. Functional Cookies

Functional cookies allow us to remember your preferences and settings (such as language, region, or interface view). They help personalize your experience without storing identifiable data.

**Examples:**
- Language and localization settings
- Saved display preferences
- Remembered user choices within sessions

### c. Analytical/Performance Cookies

These cookies collect aggregated, anonymized data about user interaction with the platform. They help us improve usability and performance.

**Examples:**
- Pages visited and time spent on each section
- Features used or ignored
- Browser or device type

**Tools Used:**
- Asaman’s internal analytics dashboard
- Occasionally, privacy-compliant analytics partners (e.g., Matomo, AWS CloudWatch, or Azure Insights)

### d. Optional Third-Party Cookies

With the school’s consent, Asaman may integrate approved third-party services (e.g., embedded maps, calendar sync, or helpdesk chat). These providers may set their own cookies to enable their services. No third-party advertising or marketing tracking is used on Asaman’s educational platform.

### e. Similar Tracking Technologies

We may also use equivalent technologies such as:
- Web beacons or tracking pixels (for email notifications or security monitoring)
- Local storage or session storage (to maintain preferences)

All such technologies follow the same privacy safeguards as cookies.

1. Enabling secure login and platform navigation  
2. Authenticating users and maintaining sessions  
3. Remembering preferences and language settings  
4. Monitoring technical performance and reliability  
5. Detecting errors, fraud, or unauthorized access  
6. Generating anonymized reports to improve service delivery
