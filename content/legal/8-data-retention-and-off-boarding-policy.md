---

**Effective Date:** Oct 28th, 2025

## 1. Purpose

This Policy defines how Asaman Technologies Ltd. manages, retains, exports, and deletes information processed through the Asaman platform. It ensures transparency for schools, administrators, and parents regarding the duration of data storage, retrieval methods, and the handling of data deletion after contract termination.

This Policy forms part of the contractual framework with client schools and must be read in conjunction with Asaman’s Terms of Service, Data Processing Agreement (DPA), and Privacy Policy.

## 2. The Scope

This Policy applies to all personal and institutional data stored or processed by Asaman on behalf of subscribing schools, including but not limited to:

- Student, parent, and staff profiles
- Activity and attendance records
- Schedules, timetables, and provider details
- Payment, billing, and transaction data
- Communications and reports
- Uploaded documents, images, and lesson materials
- System logs, analytics, and backups

This Policy covers live systems, test environments, and encrypted backup archives.

## 3. Core Retention Principles

- **Data Ownership:** The data of all schools remains the exclusive property of the School.
- **Purpose Limitation:** Data are kept only for as long as necessary to provide services or comply with the law.
- **Security and Confidentiality:** All retained data is encrypted and access-controlled.
- **Transparency:** Schools are informed of all applicable retention and deletion controls.
- **Right to Erasure:** Schools can request deletion at any time through the platform or by providing written notice.

## 5. Data Export And Off-boarding Process

When a School’s contract ends or is not renewed:

- **Notification:** The School confirms termination or non-renewal in writing.
- **Access Period:** The platform remains read-only for up to **90 days** to allow data export.
- **Self-Service Export:** Administrators can export data directly through the dashboard in **CSV, Excel, or PDF** formats.
- **Assisted Export (Optional):** Asaman provides a secure, encrypted download of all data sets upon request.
- **Confirmation:** Asaman issues a written confirmation and begins secure deletion once export is completed.

## 6. Secure Deletion And Verification

After the 90-day archive period:

- All databases linked to the School are deleted from production servers.
- Encrypted backups containing related data are overwritten during the next 30-day backup cycle.
- Cryptographic erasure ensures data cannot be reconstructed.
- A deletion log is retained internally for audit verification for six (06) months, containing only anonymized metadata.

Once deletion is complete, data cannot be restored or recovered.

## 7. Early Deletion or Partial Requests

- Schools may request the deletion of specific records (e.g., those of former students) at any time.
- An authorized administrator must submit requests, which will be executed within **30 days** of receiving written confirmation.
- Legal or financial records required for compliance (e.g., invoices) will be retained until the applicable statutory period has expired.

## 8. Backup Management

- Full-encrypted backups occur daily, with incremental snapshots taken hourly.
- Backups are stored only in the same geographic region as the School’s primary data.
- Deleted data is fully purged from all backups within **30 days**.
- Access to backup environments is limited to authorized security personnel.

## 9. Legal or Regulatory Retention Exceptions

Asaman may retain specific data longer where required to:

- Comply with applicable laws or tax regulations
- Resolve ongoing legal disputes or protect contractual rights
- Respond to government or judicial requests
- Investigate misuse or fraud

Once such obligations expire, data are securely deleted in line with Section 6.

## 10. Verification And Auditing

- Asaman’s Data Protection Office conducts annual internal audits to confirm compliance with this Policy.
- Upon written request, contracted Schools may receive an audit summary report or deletion certificate confirming the final status of their data.

## 11. Roles And Responsibilities

- **Asaman (Processor):** Responsible for secure storage, deletion, and verification.
- **School (Controller):** Responsible for initiating data-export or deletion requests and maintaining its records of processing activities.
- **Sub-Processors:** Bound by contractual terms and required to follow identical deletion timelines.
